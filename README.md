# Fan-Speed-Control-with-and-without-Internet-

In this project, we made a fan regulator circuit using ESP32 board in which you'll be able to control the speed of your ceiling fan over interent usign Blynk app on your smart phone.
And not only that you can also control the speed with the regular fan speed regulator which you use in your day to day life and you'll also get realtime feedback of the manual control on your blynk app.
And In case your internet is not working, then also you will be able to control the speed of the fan manually using that fan regulator. 



So basically it all started with reverse enginnering a fan regulator circuit and studying all it's components and connections. You can watch out this video to know how we made a fan regulator from scrtach.
